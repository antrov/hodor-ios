# hodor-ios
iOS application for recording the door acceleration along with face detection of opener

## Requirements

* Xcode 9+
* iOS 7+
* iOS SDK 8

Because whole project is written in Swift (die ObjC, die!) and the only unused phone i had was iPhone 4 there was some magic necessary. To support Swift on iOS 7 with Static Libs you have to copy SDK like in the sh file.
